# project-rock-paper-scissors

This is a project from 'The Odin Project', https://www.theodinproject.com.

The assignement is to create a game of 'Rock, paper, scissor' where the user is playing against the computer. The application will at this stage be a console application, but will eventually be reformed to get an UI at a later stage of the course.
